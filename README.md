Repeated Tender Market Share : A GTES project to simulate closed B2B market equilibriums


1. Project Description 
======================

This project is part of my program to study market equilibriums with GTES. RTMS looks at repeated tenders, that are closed B2B markets with multiple bids between the same set of players in a long period of time.
